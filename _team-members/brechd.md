Brecht started in September 2018 as Java Developer at Cegeka. He soon got the chance to learn something completely new for him, namely OutSystems, a low-code platform. He then devoted himself to this and after several test projects and a large number of online lessons, he gained sufficient knowledge to start some real projects in OutSystems soon.
