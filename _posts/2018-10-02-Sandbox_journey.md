Just to let you know: our sandbox is not exactly designed to play around with sand, as you might think. The purpose of our sandboxes is to play around with technology. In our sandbox, we play around with machine learning stuff. What that means? You will find out soon. 
We started with exploring some options in machine learning. We learned about image recognition, NLP, neural networks and decision trees. We could take the time to grasp a sense of what machine learning is about. This is the equivalent of building some castles and stars in the sand, but we longed for something bigger. Could we maybe build a city?

So the irony is that everyone who is doing machine learning wants to reduce many (if not all) problems to data problems, but mostly the biggest problem for those people is data. Fortunately, we discovered Kaggle a platform with different machine learning problems and free to use data. We looked into different datasets and eventually choose the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. It looked like it was not that hard to use. We tried to create a project from it and dived right in. As you might expect the result did not even look like a city. We learned a lot, but we were not able to establish a mini project those 2 days. Exploring the data was hard, if you donâ€™t have anyone who understands it. A product owner, someone who can guide you in decisions made about the data, would be useful. In addition, we needed to prepare better (the first time we did no technical set-up).  

Within our team, we found someone to play our product owner (after all, it is still a sandbox). Again, we turned to Kaggle to help us with a case and some data. We found the Animal Shelter dataset. We worked the other way around starting with data and from there construct a case. With this dataset, we tried to predict the outcome of dogs and cats in animal shelters. If an animal comes in to the shelter, would we be able to predict whether the animal will leave the shelter alive or if the poor thing will die there. If the prediction says the animal is likely to die, maybe it is possible to invest some more marketing resources in those animals. 
The preparation up front was setting up a Restful API with Python and creating an Angular project. We wanted to have a front-end, so it was more tangible if we did a demo for our product owner. We also talked to our product owner about what his expectations were. What is it he wants to find out and why? All these lessons learned prepared us for our next sandbox journey.
